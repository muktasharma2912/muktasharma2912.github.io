<li><p> Summer Internship in the experimental study of the implementation of Arduino UNO for segregation of different types of 
materials based on the capacitance of a capacitor when different materials act as a dielectric medium under the guidance of Dr.

<dt>1. Image and Video Inpainting Library:</dt>
<dd><p>Present an image and video inpainting library which can be used for several inpainting tasks such as object removal, old movie gate hair removal, and image inpainting. It contains several automatic detectors to generate refined masks for the different objects to be removed including old movie gate hair and other specific objects. It also combines several traditional techniques (like optical flow, Poisson image editing, etc.) and deep learning-based models to fix the videos and images. Collaborated with <a href="http://www.mtifilm.com/">MTI Film</a> and use the library is used to fix some old movies&rsquo; gate hair. Also used this library to fix a movie pilot, Functional Chaos, by Will Shivers, and have credit on that. The library is implemented by C/C++, OpenCV, Eigen, and LibTorch. <br /></p></dd>

<dt>2. Volumetric Capture:</dt>
<dd><p>Present a novel background removal method with a high degree of accuracy in a purpose-built volumetric capture stage, which could record performances and convert them into 3D sequences viewable from any angle. The algorithm beats current state-of-art methods in our situation, combines deep learning and traditional techniques such as joint bilateral upsampling. It is also suitable for small volumetric capture systems such as face dome and object scan. Implement with PyTorch in training and also deliver software using C/C++, OpenCV, and LibTorch. Achieving fast speed with high-resolution output by adopting CUDA programming in the application.<br /></p></dd>
